### My Name is NO_skcaj 
##### Chief of the 3824 Robotics Team

I’ve been gooning since 1999 when I discovered Holy C and realized that the only thing I cared about was programming the most holy code in an attempt to discover the 3rd and final temple in order to bring back our glorious God, the Flying Spaghetti Monster, and this enlightening revelation was brought to you by Dean Kamen, inventor of the Segway and co-founder of FIRST.

Seriously though, I'm the programming lead for my robotics team. I write C++, utilizing libraries from WPI, CTR, REV, Studica, and other community built libraries. As a part of being the programming lead, I also help teach high schoolers programming, giving them hands on experience with real production code. The robots I and my team write code for are worth >$10,000 and weigh upwards of 120 lbs; they require a lot of care and a lot of QC to make work.

Skills: C++

- 🔭 I’m currently working on worshipping Terry Davis, rust as a web backend. and FRC robotics in C++.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Java, and Rust.
- 💬 Ask me about robotics, why C++ is perfection, our lord and saviour the Flying Spaghetti Monster, Terry Davis, and why C++ is possibly the worst language ever cobbled together.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with not crying about external library bugs that make my code no worky, also fixing my skill issues. Also, rust web backend.
- 📫 To reach me: Talk is cheap, send PR's.
